# gulimall

Gulimall is a self-operated mall platform, which consists of a cluster system + backend management system.

This project covers the full-stack technology of distributed development, including front-and-back full-stack development, Restful interface, data verification, gateway, registration discovery, configuration center, fuse, current limit, downgrade,
Link tracking, performance monitoring, stress testing, system warning, cluster deployment, continuous integration, continuous deployment.

This project will be devided into 3 parts, basic distributed part, advanced distributed part, and high-availability cluster deployment part, details are shown below, updates are continuous.

### Basic distributed part (Finished)

Use SpringBoot + Vue + reverse engineering to build a full set of backend management system, using the front and back separation method.

### Advanced distributed part (Ongoingï¼‰

Develop the entire mall system with SpringBoot + SpringCloud + SpringCloud Alibaba series. Nacos registration center/configuration center, Sentinel traffic protection system, Seata distributed transaction & RabbitMQ flexible transaction solution,
SpringCloud-Gateway gateway, Feign remote call, Sleuth+Zipkin link tracking system, Spring Cache cache, SpringSession cross-subdomain Session synchronization solution, based on ElasticSearch7 full-text retrieval, asynchronous orchestration and thread pool,
Stress test tuning, Redisson distributed lock, distributed semaphore.

### High-availability cluster deployment part

Develop a full set of pipeline based on kubesphere and k8s. To be continued...
